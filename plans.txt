Tome of Power effects:
- Pistol has infinite ammo and pierces.
- SMG shots ricochet and fire two shots at once
- Shotgun/Kahuna shots fire ricocheting pellets that explode upon contact with an enemy
- SSG charges really fast and shots pierce. You do not need to reload between regular shots
- Rocket fires charged shots normally, charged shots do Sparkle Bomber flash bomb explosions
- Grenade launcher shots make a smaller explosion with each bounce. It charges faster too.
- Fists turn into the Hokuto Hyakuretsu-ken

"UnderShirt" levels:
- Lv1: stay alive at 1 HP, invulnerability for a few tics
- Lv2: stay live with invulnerability for a few seconds
- Lv3: 50 HP

Medic Bag
An item that replaces portable medkit. Can collect excess health to use.
-Pick up more bags to increase capacity, starts at 50, goes up by 25.
-Only a fraction is gained from items. This fraction can be made larger with upgrades.

Multiplayer version, mostly for Deathmatch, and a lite version further down the line?

Beowulf DMC3 boots upgrade that makes the kick shiny, light, and spammable

Impactor upgrade: Ifrit fist (huge fire punch deals tons of damage and leaves burn effect)

Arch-vile replacements:
	Only big difference is type of magic used;
	- LoS electric shots + resurrection
	- Homing projectiles + healing nearby enemies
	- Crazy explosive shot that sends you flying + acid rain spell

IMMEDIATE TODO LIST:
- Make fire damage faster
- Give Ice a wider spread, maybe make mist more damaging/faster as well

Stuff to pull from Kegan's mods:
- Hunter's Knives (and the holy water part) from Combined_Arms GAIDEN, turned into instantly-usable items, recolored to be 16-bit
- Sword and staff from Past-Linked class in Combined_Arms
